TRIS Spanish-German parallel corpus, v.01, v02 and v03
====

Full resource name: Parallel Corpus of documents from the Technical Regulations Information System for German-Spanish.

Specialized parallel corpus Spanish-German (ES-ES, DE-AT and DE-DE), texts from the European Commission between 1997-2010.

The texts are technical regulations in a variety of domains. This third version is sentence aligned and is in TMX and
TEI format. TMX files are sentence-aligned while TEI encoded files have the information about sentence alignment in stand-off 
annotation. 

Versions 0.1 and 0.2 are kept as individual records because they are (currently) intended to be downloaded individually. 
Version 0.3 is encoded in TEI P5 and includes files from two new domains not included in versions 0.1 and 0.2: 
C00A (Agriculture, Fishing and Foodstuffs), which is currently under alignment and H00 (Domestic and Leisure Equipment), 
which includes all files available in the database up to 2010.
